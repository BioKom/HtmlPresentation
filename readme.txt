Presentation with Html
======================

This system is for building presentation with html, css and JavaScripts.

Every slide in the presentation has it’s own htm file, so you can use a
slide in more than one presentation. If you modify slides or other
content, this modification will influence all presentations where the
content is used. In this way you can easily handle more than one slide for
the same topic.

Folders:
- .: This folder should contain the presentations. In the presentations
   you just have to add the slide filenames.
- clients: The folder with the htm files for different clients (wher you
   give the presentation).
- content: The folder for the slide content.
- numbers: This folder contains htm files for the page number. (You won’t
   have to change it. I would like to remove it and use other ways for the
   page numbering, but don’t know how.)
